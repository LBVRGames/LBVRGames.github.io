Welcome to LBVR Games! We're glad you found your way to this little corner of the internet. Our goal is to bring together (location-based) virtual reality enthusiasts who want to join us in our quest (pun intended!) to foster a community of like-minded creators.

LBVR Games will consist of two branches. On one side, we’ll post tutorials related to LBVR development using Unreal Engine.

On the other side, we’ll review LBVR games and provide recommendations on how to install and use them. So, stay tuned for that!

We hope you'll join us on this journey! See you soon!!!
