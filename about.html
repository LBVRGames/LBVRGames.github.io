  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  <p>This website is created by Bart and Wout, both software developers with a strong passion for virtual reality. Bart, an early adopter of VR, has been closely following its advancements since the release of the Oculus DK1. A few years later, he convinced his spouse to remove their dining table to make room for the original HTC Vive in their living room. In 2018, Bart and Wout received a small grant from IEEE to develop a demo for their IEEE Young Professionals: Arctic Challenge project titled “Arctic VR Education.” Afterward, Bart began working on a VR arena in collaboration with a local indoor playground. However, these plans were halted due to the onset of COVID-19. Three years later, Bart reconnected with the indoor playground, and this time the VR arena was approved. The official opening took place in February 2024.</p>

<p>Wout met Bart at university in 2015 and developed an interest in virtual reality through him. He followed Bart’s journey from experimenting with the HTC Vive to building the VR arena. Together, they completed the arena in just six months. Being technically inclined, they decided to handle everything themselves, from network installation and configuration to building custom PCs, setting up VR headsets, and installing the necessary software. The end result is something truly unique and can be experienced at <a href="https://explorijck.be/nl/zinderrijck/virtual-reality/">ZinderRijck</a> in Belgium.</p>
